# üè® Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction Project

## üìå Overview

This project analyzes hotel booking data to understand what drives cancellations and builds a machine learning model to **predict whether a booking will be canceled**. Accurate predictions empower hotels to:

- **Reduce revenue loss**
- **Optimize operational resources**
- **Improve customer satisfaction**

## üéØ Project Goal

Develop a machine learning model to predict booking cancellations, enabling:

- üí∞ **Revenue Management**: Adjust pricing dynamically and manage overbooking smartly.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Operational Efficiency**: Allocate staff and rooms effectively based on likely occupancy.
- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Customer Engagement**: Intervene proactively with guests likely to cancel.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Key Insights:

- **Lead Time**: Long lead times show higher cancellation likelihood.
- **Market Segment**: Online channels present higher cancellation rates.
- **Guest History**: Guests with prior cancellations are more likely to cancel again.
- **Special Requests**: More requests may indicate higher commitment (lower cancellations).
- **Room Price**: Very high or very low prices may affect cancellation behavior.
- **Arrival Dates**: Seasonal patterns (month/year) influence cancellations.

---

## üßπ Preprocessing Steps

- Created a working copy (`df_model`) to preserve raw data.
- Transformed `booking_status` into binary:  
  - `1` = Canceled  
  - `0` = Not_Canceled
- Applied `LabelEncoder` to categorical variables.
- Removed `Booking_ID` as it's non-informative.
- Split the data into training (80%) and test (20%) sets using `stratify=y`.

---

## ü§ñ Modeling

### Model Used: `RandomForestClassifier`

- Chosen for its robustness and ability to handle both categorical and numeric data.
- Config: `n_estimators=100`, `random_state=42`, `n_jobs=-1`

### Performance Metrics:

| Metric                 | Value      |

| **Precision (Canceled)** | 89.39%   |
| **Recall (Canceled)**    | 81.53%   |
| **F1 Score (Canceled)**  | 85.28%   |

## üìå Feature Importance (Top Drivers)

Key factors that influence cancellations:

- `lead_time`
- `market_segment_type`
- `avg_price_per_room`
