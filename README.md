Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction Project
Overview
This project aims to analyze a hotel booking dataset to understand factors influencing booking cancellations and build a predictive model to identify bookings likely to be canceled. By accurately predicting cancellations, hotels can implement proactive strategies to mitigate revenue loss, optimize resource allocation, and enhance customer satisfaction.

Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a hotel booking will be canceled or not. This prediction can help hotels in:

Revenue Management: Dynamic pricing and overbooking strategies.

Operational Efficiency: Optimizing staff and resource allocation.

Customer Relationship Management: Proactive engagement with guests at risk of cancellation.

Data Description
The dataset used in this project, hotel.csv, contains various attributes related to hotel bookings. Below is a detailed data dictionary:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Key Insights
The EDA phase involved univariate analysis for both quantitative and categorical variables. Some key insights from this analysis include:

Lead Time: Bookings with longer lead_time (booked far in advance) might have a higher cancellation rate, as guests have more time for plans to change.

Average Price per Room: The distribution of avg_price_per_room could show common price ranges, and deviations from these could indicate premium or budget bookings which might have different cancellation behaviors.

Market Segment Type: Certain market_segment_types (e.g., "Online") tend to have more bookings, and their cancellation rates could differ significantly from "Offline" or "Corporate" segments.

Previous Cancellations/Bookings: Guests with a history of no_of_previous_cancellations are likely to cancel again, whereas no_of_previous_bookings_not_canceled could indicate more reliable guests.

Special Requests: Bookings with a higher no_of_special_requests might indicate more committed guests, potentially leading to lower cancellation rates.

Arrival Period: Cancellation patterns might vary by arrival_month and arrival_year, possibly due to seasonality or specific events.

Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps prepared the data for machine learning:

Duplicate DataFrame: A copy of the original DataFrame (df_model) was created to avoid modifying the raw data.

Target Variable Transformation: The booking_status column was transformed into a binary numerical format: 'Canceled' became 1, and 'Not_Canceled' (including 'No-Show' for this binary classification) became 0.

Categorical Feature Encoding: LabelEncoder was applied to all other categorical columns. Missing values in these columns were imputed with 'Unknown' before encoding.

Feature and Target Separation: Features (X) and the target variable (y) were separated. Booking_ID was dropped as it's an identifier, not a predictive feature.

Train-Test Split: The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using stratify=y to maintain the proportion of cancellation statuses in both sets, which is crucial for imbalanced datasets.

Modeling
A RandomForestClassifier was chosen as the initial model for predicting booking cancellations.

Model Choice: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction. It's robust to overfitting and can handle various data types.

Parameters: n_estimators=100 (100 trees), random_state=42 (for reproducibility), and n_jobs=-1 (to utilize all available CPU cores for faster training).

Results
After training, the model's performance was evaluated using standard classification metrics:

Classification Report: Provides precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class (canceled vs. not canceled). This gives a comprehensive view of the model's performance on the test set.

Confusion Matrix: A visual representation showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. This helps understand where the model is making errors (e.g., misclassifying canceled bookings as not canceled).

Feature Importance: The Random Forest model provides insights into the importance of each feature in making predictions. This helps identify the most influential factors contributing to booking cancellations.

The detailed classification_report, confusion_matrix visualization, and feature_importances plot are available in the Jupyter Notebook output.

Business Insights & Recommendations
Based on the analysis and model results, here are some actionable business insights:

Identify High-Risk Bookings: The model can flag bookings with a high probability of cancellation. This allows hotel staff to:

Proactively Contact Guests: Offer flexible terms, personalized incentives (e.g., discounted upgrades, complimentary services), or simply reconfirm details to reduce uncertainty.

Optimize Overbooking: Adjust overbooking strategies more intelligently, minimizing "no-shows" while avoiding turning away paying guests.

Revenue Optimization:

Dynamic Pricing: If certain market segments or lead times are prone to higher cancellations, pricing strategies can be adjusted for those segments or periods.

Package Deals: Create non-refundable or discounted packages for high-risk segments to secure bookings.

Operational Planning:

Staffing: Better prediction of actual occupancy allows for more efficient staff scheduling (housekeeping, front desk).

Inventory Management: Anticipate room availability more accurately, reducing last-minute scramble or idle rooms.

Targeted Marketing:

Loyalty Programs: Guests with a history of non-cancellations (no_of_previous_bookings_not_canceled) are valuable. Hotels can focus loyalty programs and special offers on these reliable customers.

Cancellation Policy Review: If lead_time or market_segment_type consistently show high cancellation rates, the hotel's cancellation policies for these areas might need review or adjustment (e.g., stricter policies for very long lead times or specific online channels).

Understanding Key Drivers: The Feature Importance analysis helps pinpoint which factors are most influential in predicting cancellations. For example, if lead_time and avg_price_per_room are highly important, it suggests that booking behavior changes significantly based on how far in advance a room is booked and its price. This insight can drive strategic decisions on marketing, sales, and pricing.

Next Steps
To further enhance this project and its business value, consider the following:

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the RandomForestClassifier (or other models) parameters using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

Feature Engineering: Create new features from existing ones (e.g., total number of nights, day of the week of arrival, season).

More Advanced Models: Explore other machine learning algorithms such as Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM), Support Vector Machines, or Neural Networks.

Addressing Imbalance: If the dataset is highly imbalanced (e.g., many more non-cancellations than cancellations), explore techniques like SMOTE or class weighting.

Time-Series Analysis: Incorporate time-series aspects if data over a longer period is available to capture seasonal trends and long-term patterns.

Deployment: Once a satisfactory model is developed, consider deploying it into a real-time system to assist hotel operations directly.
